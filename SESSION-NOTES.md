üß™ Focus
Scaffold Lab 2: Networking Tools and Diagnostics in the linux-labs GitHub repository using WSL on Windows.
________________________________________
üîß Issues Encountered & Resolutions
1. Missing Project Directory
‚Ä¢	Issue: cd ~/projects/linux-labs returned ‚ÄúNo such file or directory.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Resolution: Created the directory manually using mkdir -p ~/projects/linux-labs.
2. GitHub SSH Authentication Failure
‚Ä¢	Issue: git clone failed with ‚ÄúPlease make sure you have the correct access rights.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Resolution: 
o	Generated a new SSH key with ssh-keygen -t ed25519
o	Added the public key to GitHub under SSH settings
o	Verified connection with ssh -T git@github.com
3. Network Unreachable on Port 22
‚Ä¢	Issue: git push failed with ‚Äússh: connect to host github.com port 22: Network is unreachable.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Resolution: Switched to GitHub‚Äôs alternate SSH port (443) using: 
‚Ä¢	git remote set-url origin ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/YourVice81/linux-labs.git
4. DNS Resolution Failure in WSL
‚Ä¢	Issue: ping github.com and apt update failed with ‚ÄúTemporary failure in name resolution.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Resolution: 
o	Disabled auto-DNS generation via .wslconfig
o	Manually set /etc/resolv.conf with Google and Cloudflare DNS
o	Locked the file with chattr +i to prevent overwrites
o	Restarted WSL with wsl --shutdown
5. Git Identity Not Set
‚Ä¢	Issue: Git prompted to set default identity.
‚Ä¢	Resolution: Configured global identity with: 
‚Ä¢	git config --global user.name "Victor Yurtola"
‚Ä¢	git config --global user.email "YouVice81@github.com"
6. Not Inside a Git Repo
‚Ä¢	Issue: ‚Äúfatal: not a git repository‚Äù when running Git commands.
‚Ä¢	Resolution: Navigated to correct directory and confirmed .git presence.
________________________________________
‚úÖ Achievements
‚Ä¢	SSH key securely configured and tested
‚Ä¢	DNS resolution restored inside WSL
‚Ä¢	GitHub remote set to alternate SSH port for reliable access
‚Ä¢	Lab 2 folder scaffolded with OBJECTIVES.md and exercise1.md
‚Ä¢	First exercise built around ip a output and interface diagnostics
‚Ä¢	Branch lab2-networking created, committed, and pushed successfully

üß† Reflections
‚Ä¢	Troubleshooting is part of the craft‚Äîeach issue deepened understanding of WSL, Git, and network behavior.
‚Ä¢	DNS and SSH setup are foundational for any DevOps workflow; documenting these steps will help others.
‚Ä¢	The process reinforced the value of methodical problem-solving and clean environment setup.

üßº Next Steps
‚Ä¢	Scaffold Exercise 2: ping diagnostics and latency interpretation
‚Ä¢	Add lab roadmap to README for easier navigation
‚Ä¢	Create a reusable session closeout checklist (SESSION-CLOSE.md)
‚Ä¢	Consider scripting environment setup for future labs
